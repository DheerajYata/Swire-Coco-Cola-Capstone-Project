# Swire Coca-Cola Capstone Project: Predictive Maintenance

## Summary of Business Problem and Project Objective

Swire Coca-Cola, a leading bottler in the United States, operates six production plants and produces approximately 192 million beverage cases annually. However, the company faces significant operational disruptions due to frequent unplanned machine downtimes, which reduce production efficiency to only 94.4% of ordered cases. This inefficiency results in an estimated annual loss of $60 million. The primary objective of this project was to transition Swire Coca-Cola from a reactive maintenance approach to a proactive one by leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling. The focus was on reducing unplanned downtimes, improving machine reliability and operational efficiency, optimizing maintenance schedules, and providing actionable recommendations driven by data insights.

## Our Group's Solution

The team approached the problem systematically by utilizing the CRISP-DM framework, which provided a structured methodology to address the business challenge. The project began with an in-depth understanding of the business objectives, which helped in defining the scope of the problem and outlining actionable goals for predictive maintenance. We then analyzed over 1.4 million work order records from multiple plants, identifying patterns and key drivers of downtime through exploratory data analysis (EDA). Addressing missing data and refining the dataset allowed us to isolate critical predictors such as maintenance types and functional area nodes.

Feature engineering played a crucial role in creating meaningful variables like breakdown frequency, time between failures, and downtime trends, which enhanced the predictive power of our models. We employed advanced modeling techniques, including Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox Proportional Hazard Models, and time-series analysis, to gain insights into machine breakdowns and seasonal patterns. The evaluation phase identified high-risk equipment and locations, while insights into seasonal downtime trends helped refine maintenance schedules. Finally, we recommended a proactive maintenance strategy targeting high-risk equipment such as fillers and packers, along with inventory optimization and resource alignment to minimize disruptions and enhance production reliability.

## My Contribution to the Project

As a key contributor to the project, I played a significant role in data analysis, modeling, and delivering actionable insights. During the data exploration phase, I addressed missing data and conducted thorough exploratory data analysis to uncover critical trends and drivers of machine downtime, providing insights that guided the team’s approach. I developed few visualizations that effectively communicated the findings to stakeholders, enabling a deeper understanding of the operational challenges.

In feature engineering, I created impactful variables such as time-to-failure metrics and downtime trends, which enhanced the models’ predictive capabilities. I meticulously analyzed the factors contributing to machine downtime, prioritizing actionable insights that addressed the project’s objectives. On the modeling front, I worked extensively with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox Proportional Hazard Models to predict time-to-failure and identify high-risk factors. I also leveraged time-series models to uncover breakdown patterns and seasonal trends, providing actionable strategies for optimizing maintenance.

Additionally, I contributed to documentation and communication by proofreading deliverables to ensure clarity and alignment with business objectives. My involvement in the final presentation ensured that our technical findings were translated into actionable recommendations that addressed Swire Coca-Cola's strategic goals.

## Business Value of the Solution

The solutions developed through this project offer substantial business value to Swire Coca-Cola. By transitioning from a reactive to a proactive maintenance strategy, the company can significantly reduce machine downtimes, potentially saving up to $60 million annually. The recommendations provided include tailored maintenance schedules and a focus on high-risk equipment, which will improve operational efficiency and production reliability. Furthermore, the data-driven approach established a foundation for long-term predictive maintenance, aligning with the company's strategic goals. Optimized resource allocation, such as inventory planning for critical spare parts, minimizes production disruptions and enhances overall operational stability.

## Difficulties Encountered

Despite the project’s success, the team faced several challenges that required innovative solutions. Data quality issues were a significant hurdle, with critical variables like maintenance plans having a high percentage of missing values (89%). Inconsistent documentation practices across plants further complicated the data cleaning process. Balancing model interpretability and predictive accuracy presented another challenge, as it was crucial to align the technical results with business requirements. Additionally, computational constraints limited our ability to test advanced models and perform extensive hyperparameter tuning. Finally, time constraints posed challenges in conducting exhaustive analyses across datasets, but the team effectively managed these hurdles to deliver meaningful results.

## What I Learned

This project was a rich learning experience that provided both technical and practical insights. I gained expertise in advanced analytics techniques, including survival analysis and time-series modeling, which proved invaluable in addressing the business problem. The project enhanced my visualization skills, enabling me to communicate complex findings effectively through impactful visual narratives. Collaborating with a diverse team honed my teamwork and communication abilities, ensuring seamless integration of individual contributions. The project also deepened my understanding of the impact of machine downtime on production flow and business performance, reinforcing the importance of aligning technical solutions with strategic goals. Overall, this experience has strengthened my problem-solving and strategic thinking skills, equipping me to tackle similar challenges in the future.
