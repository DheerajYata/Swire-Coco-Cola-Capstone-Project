# Swire Coca-Cola Capstone Project: Predictive Maintenance 

## Summary of Business Problem and Project Objective

Swire Coca-Cola, a leading U.S. Coca-Cola bottler, operates six production plants and produces nearly 192 million beverage cases annually. However, frequent unplanned machine downtimes disrupt operations, reducing production efficiency to 94.4% of ordered cases and resulting in annual losses of $60 million.

**Objective:**  
The project aimed to transition Swire Coca-Cola from a reactive to a proactive maintenance strategy by leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling. The main goals were to:

- Reduce unplanned downtimes and associated costs.
- Enhance machine reliability and operational efficiency.
- Optimize maintenance schedules for improved production output.
- Provide actionable, data-driven recommendations.

## Our Group's Solution

To tackle this challenge, the team adopted the **CRISP-DM Framework**, systematically progressing through six phases:

1. **Business Understanding:**  
   Defined the scope of the problem and outlined objectives for predictive maintenance.
   
2. **Data Understanding:**  
   - Analyzed over 1.4 million work order records across multiple plants and equipment categories.
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and drivers of downtime.
   - Addressed missing data and identified critical predictors, such as maintenance type and functional nodes.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Created new variables, including breakdown frequency, time between failures, and downtime trends.
   - Prioritized features influencing machine breakdowns.

4. **Modeling:**  
   - Developed predictive models using **Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis**, **Cox Proportional Hazard Models**, and **time-series analysis**.
   - Evaluated models for performance and interpretability.

5. **Evaluation:**  
   - Identified high-risk equipment and locations for targeted maintenance.
   - Analyzed seasonal downtime trends to optimize scheduling.

6. **Deployment Recommendations:**  
   - Transitioned to proactive maintenance for high-risk equipment like fillers and packers.
   - Suggested inventory optimization for critical spare parts.
   - Provided data-driven insights for aligning maintenance during low-demand periods.

## My Contribution to the Project

- Developed visualizations that clearly communicated insights to stakeholders.

### Feature Engineering
- Designed critical features, such as time-to-failure metrics and downtime trends, to improve model performance and interpretability.
- Analyzed factors contributing to machine downtime, prioritizing actionable insights.

### Modeling
- Worked extensively with **Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis** and **Cox Proportional Hazard Models** to predict time-to-failure and identify risk factors.
- Leveraged time-series models to provide insights into breakdown patterns and seasonal trends.

### Documentation and Communication
- Proofread project deliverables to ensure accuracy, clarity, and alignment with business goals.
- Contributed to the final presentation, translating technical findings into actionable strategies for Swire Coca-Cola stakeholders.

## Business Value of the Solution

The proposed solution offered the following business benefits:

1. **Downtime Reduction:**  
   Transitioned from reactive to proactive maintenance, reducing machine downtime and saving an estimated $60 million annually.

2. **Operational Efficiency:**  
   Optimized maintenance schedules and prioritized high-risk equipment, improving overall production reliability.

3. **Data-Driven Decision Making:**  
   Established a foundation for predictive maintenance, enabling Swire Coca-Cola to plan for long-term operational success.

4. **Resource Optimization:**  
   Improved inventory planning for critical spare parts, minimizing disruptions.

## Difficulties Encountered

Despite the success of the project, we faced several challenges:

- **Data Quality Issues:**  
   - Missing data in critical variables, such as maintenance plans (89% missing values).  
   - Inconsistent documentation practices across plants.

- **Modeling Trade-offs:**  
   - Balancing model interpretability and predictive power to align with business needs.
   - Computational limitations for testing advanced models and hyperparameter tuning.

- **Time Constraints:**  
   - Limited time to conduct exhaustive analyses across datasets and methodologies.

## What I Learned

This project provided numerous learning opportunities, including:

1. **Advanced Analytics Techniques:**  
   - Mastery of survival analysis and its application in predictive maintenance.
   - Proficiency in feature engineering and time-series analysis for operational insights.

2. **Visualization Skills:**  
   - Developed impactful visualizations that communicated findings effectively to stakeholders.

3. **Collaboration:**  
   - Worked in a team setting, ensuring seamless integration of individual contributions.

4. **Business Acumen:**  
   - Gained a deeper understanding of how machine downtime impacts production flow and overall business performance.

5. **Strategic Thinking:**  
   - Focused on delivering actionable solutions that align with Swire Coca-Cola's strategic objectives.
